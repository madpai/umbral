# Decision Log

Record consequential technical, process, and repository decisions here. Design decisions belong in the Design Bible. Detailed architectural decisions that need durable context, alternatives, and consequences live in [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/README.md) as ADRs.

## 2026-07-24 — Dependency-free bootstrap validation

- **Status:** accepted
- **Context:** The repository requires immediately runnable validation without selecting an engine or package manager.
- **Decision:** Use Python 3.11+ standard library tooling for the Milestone 000 validation command.
- **Consequences:** CI has no third-party dependency. Engine-specific tooling needs a later decision.
